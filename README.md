## WARNING!
**This engine is very early in development and is currently being written by a lone programmer with little to no experience in programming game engines, and as such, is not recommended for deployment unless you absolutely know what you're doing, because I (mostly) don't.**

By the way, this *should* serve as a motivator for you to make your own game engine. If a daft-headed buffoon like me can make it so far into development on my own with my only resources being what little there is of WebGPU tutorials, and StackOverflow answers, and half-baked libraries, and *grade-school knowledge of math*, you should be able to outdo me exponentially with the resources I've provided you, given you have the willpower to do so.
